Equipment:
Table: Rectangular, usually 7, 8, or 9 feet long, with six pockets (one at each corner and two on the sides).
Cue Stick: A tapered stick used to strike the cue ball.
Cue Ball: The white ball used to hit the object balls.
Object Balls: Fifteen balls numbered 1–15, divided into:
Solids (1–7): Fully colored balls.
Stripes (9–15): Balls with a white stripe.
8-Ball: The black ball, central to the game’s victory conditions.
Detailed Gameplay:
Setting Up:
Balls are racked into a triangular shape, with the 8-ball placed in the center of the rack.
Players use the cue ball to break the rack from behind the head string.
Open Table:
At the start, the table is “open,” meaning players can pocket either solids or stripes.
Once a ball is legally pocketed, the player’s group (solids or stripes) is determined.
Turn Progression:
Players continue their turn as long as they legally pocket a ball.
A turn ends if no balls are pocketed or a foul occurs.
Fouls:
Common fouls include:
Pocketing the cue ball (“scratching”).
Failing to hit any object ball.
Not striking your designated group ball first.
After a foul, the opponent gets “ball-in-hand,” allowing them to place the cue ball anywhere on the table.
Winning Conditions:
After clearing their group, a player must call and pocket the 8-ball in a specific pocket.
Failing to legally pocket the 8-ball or committing a foul while shooting it results in a loss.
Skills and Strategy:
Positioning: Planning the placement of the cue ball for subsequent shots.
Angles: Using the table’s geometry to calculate bank shots and rebounds.
Control: Mastering shot power and spin to maneuver the cue ball.
Defense: Strategically leaving difficult shots for the opponent when no offensive play is possible.
